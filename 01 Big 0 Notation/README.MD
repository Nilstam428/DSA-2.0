# Time Complexity Growth Rates

The following table summarizes common time complexities and how they affect the growth rate of an algorithm.

| Complexity | Growth Rate                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| *O(1)*   | Constant, flat growth                |
| *O(log n)* | Slow growth, logarithmic scale      |
| *O(n)*   | Linear growth                        |
| *O(n log n)* | Log-linear, grows faster         |
| *O(n²)*  | Quadratic growth, steep              |
| *O(2^n)* | Exponential growth, very steep       |
| *O(n!)*  | Factorial growth, extremely steep    |

# Space Complexity Growth Rates

The following table summarizes common space complexities and how they describe memory usage of an algorithm.

| Complexity  | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| *O(1)*    | Constant space usage                  |
| *O(log n)* | Logarithmic space usage               |
| *O(n)*    | Linear space usage                    |
| *O(n log n)* | Log-linear space usage             |
| *O(n²)*   | Quadratic space usage                 |
